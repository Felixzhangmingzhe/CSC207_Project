Place the dough in the buttered tube pan and allow it to rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 375.

A little over a year ago, someone on the Fat-Free list mentioned that all nutritional yeasts are not fortified with B12, naming Red Star T-6635+ as one source. I asked my HFS if theirs had B12. \"Absolutely\", I was told. I asked to see the label of on the 50 pound sack they use for their bulk sales, and there was no mention of B12 on it. After calling Red Star, I received a data sheet for all their nutritional yeasts. Of Red Star's yeasts, only T-6635+ contains a significant amount of B12 (0.5 mcg per gram). When I brought this to the attention of the general manager of the HFS, he immediately ordered the T-6635+ for all future shipments. While I had no immediate concern about a B12 deficiency, I had been consuming a nutritional yeast which added no B12 to my system. I noticed that the B12 fortified yeast was a much darker golden color than the ivory color of the the unfortified yeast, but that may vary from lot to lot. A heaping tablespoon of nutritional yeast is about 8 grams. (4 mcg B12) This yeast is 4.7% fat, 35% carbohydrate and 52% protein, the rest is nitrogen and moisture. There are 2.8 calories of energy per gram. 1.80√°",

Correct the seasonings. You may wich to add a bit of salt, but do not add salt until this point because salt cooks out of the ham (if present) and will season the beans. Serve over white rice.

    "isCooked": false,
    "content": "There's been some discussion of vitamin B12 in recent posts. A generally accepted assumption is that nutritional yeast is a source of B12. A little over a year ago, someone on the Fat-Free list mentioned that all nutritional yeasts are not fortified with B12, naming Red Star T-6635+ as one source. I asked my HFS if theirs had B12. \"Absolutely\", I was told. I asked to see the label of on the 50 pound sack they use for their bulk sales, and there was no mention of B12 on it. After calling Red Star, I received a data sheet for all their nutritional yeasts. Of Red Star's yeasts, only T-6635+ contains a significant amount of B12 (0.5 mcg per gram). When I brought this to the attention of the general manager of the HFS, he immediately ordered the T-6635+ for all future shipments. While I had no immediate concern about a B12 deficiency, I had been consuming a nutritional yeast which added no B12 to my system. I noticed that the B12 fortified yeast was a much darker golden color than the ivory color of the the unfortified yeast, but that may vary from lot to lot. A heaping tablespoon of nutritional yeast is about 8 grams. (4 mcg B12) This yeast is 4.7% fat, 35% carbohydrate and 52% protein, the rest is nitrogen and moisture. There are 2.8 calories of energy per gram. 1.80√°",

    "isCooked": false,
    "content": "Clean the squash, trim the ends, slice the squash in half, lengthwise, then chop in crosswise. Set aside. Chop a couple of onions up. We love it \"oniony,\" so I use big ones. Set aside. Melt 8 oz. BUTTER in a dutch kettle. Add the chopped onions and saute for about 3-4 minutes. Dump in the squash. Salt and pepper it. Put a top on the kettle, and reduce heat to simmer. Simmer for about an hour - or until the squash is very tender. Stir occasionally during the cooking period. Then mash it up with a masher (as I've discussed before, I prefer the potato ricer masher - the one that's round with the holes in it. I just think it does a much better job than the squiggly one). Add a pinch of sugar. Taste. If it needs more salt and pepper, add it. Let it simmer about 15 more minutes, then add *just* enough cream to bind it together (you do not have to add cream at all, it just makes it a little more special). Naturally, as with all vegetables, the success of this dish lies directly in how flavorful the squash themselves are. If you get good ones, and cook 'em up like this, it's a very long way from the bland, waterlogged way too many people cook vegetables. Veggies such as all squash, mushrooms, etc., which have a great deal of their own water content, should never, ever be cooked in water. The heat brings out their own water, which is sufficient.",

In a saucepan melt butter and add remaining 3 cloves of garlic, minced and salt and freshly ground black pepper. Saute briefly over low heat and add anise cooking a minute more. In a blender combine cactus fruit or plums, rose petals (reserving a few for the final garnish), and walnuts and add just enough reserved broth to cover, blend until smooth. Add blended mixture to saucepan with garlic and anise and cook 10 minutes gently stirring to mix thoroughly. If sauce is very thick, add more reserved broth. Taste for seasoning and add honey, salt and freshly ground pepper. Pour hot sauce over warm quail in casserole and serve immediately with white rice and sprinkle a few rose petals on each plate. *Note: Most roses from the florist are treated (rendering them unfit for consumption), but there are organic roses available for cooking from some specialty herb growers. Look for some red which add color and some pink which have more flavor. If you grow your own and don't spray them, they would be fine for this recipe provided you wash the petals briefly.

Mix 1/2 cup water with the chili powder to form a smooth paste; add to the meat mixture. Add salt to taste and garlic powder. Cook over medium heat, uncovered, until it is of gravy consistency. Cover and simmer over very low heat. Add more water if the chili gravy becomes too thick. Dip tortillas one at a time in the hot chili gravy with a wide metal spatula. The tortillas will become pliable almost immediately, which will make rolling the enchiladas easier. Soaking too long will cause the tortillas to fall apart. Place a good sprinkling of grated cheese and minced onion and about a tablespoon of the meat mixture to one side of the center of the tortilla. Roll tortilla tightly around the filling and place loose side down in a glass casserole baking dish. For best results place the enchilidas in a row with sides touching. When all enchiladas have been formed, pour the remaining hot chili gravy over all, and sprinkle generously with grated cheese, and top with chopped onion. Bake at 350 deg. F until the cheese is melted. Serve immediately. NOTES : Serve with canned refried beans, guacamole, picante sauce, tortilla chips, spanish rice, steamed tortillas and butter. For faster preparation, you can layer mixture in a casserole, starting with a little meat sauce in the bottom of the casserole, a layer of torn (in quarters) tortillas, another meat layer, sprinke of cheese and onions, and repeat layers, ending up with a layer of meat sauce topped with cheese and onion on top.
