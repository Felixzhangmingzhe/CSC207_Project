    "isCooked": false,
    "content": "There's been some discussion of vitamin B12 in recent posts. A generally accepted assumption is that nutritional yeast is a source of B12. A little over a year ago, someone on the Fat-Free list mentioned that all nutritional yeasts are not fortified with B12, naming Red Star T-6635+ as one source. I asked my HFS if theirs had B12. \"Absolutely\", I was told. I asked to see the label of on the 50 pound sack they use for their bulk sales, and there was no mention of B12 on it. After calling Red Star, I received a data sheet for all their nutritional yeasts. Of Red Star's yeasts, only T-6635+ contains a significant amount of B12 (0.5 mcg per gram). When I brought this to the attention of the general manager of the HFS, he immediately ordered the T-6635+ for all future shipments. While I had no immediate concern about a B12 deficiency, I had been consuming a nutritional yeast which added no B12 to my system. I noticed that the B12 fortified yeast was a much darker golden color than the ivory color of the the unfortified yeast, but that may vary from lot to lot. A heaping tablespoon of nutritional yeast is about 8 grams. (4 mcg B12) This yeast is 4.7% fat, 35% carbohydrate and 52% protein, the rest is nitrogen and moisture. There are 2.8 calories of energy per gram. 1.80á",

    "isCooked": false,
    "content": "There's been some discussion of vitamin B12 in recent posts. A generally accepted assumption is that nutritional yeast is a source of B12. A little over a year ago, someone on the Fat-Free list mentioned that all nutritional yeasts are not fortified with B12, naming Red Star T-6635+ as one source. I asked my HFS if theirs had B12. \"Absolutely\", I was told. I asked to see the label of on the 50 pound sack they use for their bulk sales, and there was no mention of B12 on it. After calling Red Star, I received a data sheet for all their nutritional yeasts. Of Red Star's yeasts, only T-6635+ contains a significant amount of B12 (0.5 mcg per gram). When I brought this to the attention of the general manager of the HFS, he immediately ordered the T-6635+ for all future shipments. While I had no immediate concern about a B12 deficiency, I had been consuming a nutritional yeast which added no B12 to my system. I noticed that the B12 fortified yeast was a much darker golden color than the ivory color of the the unfortified yeast, but that may vary from lot to lot. A heaping tablespoon of nutritional yeast is about 8 grams. (4 mcg B12) This yeast is 4.7% fat, 35% carbohydrate and 52% protein, the rest is nitrogen and moisture. There are 2.8 calories of energy per gram. 1.80á",

I crumbled the cake and mixed it with the mousse and put them in individual containers.] E. David writes: Nearly everyone knows and appreciates the old and reliable formula for a chocolate mousse-4 yolks beaten into 4 oz. of melted bitter chocolate, and the 4 whipped whites folded in. Here is a slightly different version, its faint orange flavor giving it originality. Break 4 oz of good quality bitter chocolate into squares and put in a fireproof dish in a low oven. When the chocolate is soft, after a few minutes, take it from the oven, stir in 4 well-beaten yolks, then 1 oz. of softened butter, then the juice of 1 orange. Use a Seville orange when in season; its aromatic flavor comes through better than that of the sweet orange. Beat the 4 egg whites as for a souffle and fold them into the chocolate mixture. Pour into little pots, glasses, or coffee-cups. This quantity will fill 6. Put in the refrigerator or a cool larder until ready to serve. Should you have some orange liqueur such as Grand Marnier or Curaao, add a spoonful in place of the same amount of orange juice.",

Mix 1/2 cup water with the chili powder to form a smooth paste; add to the meat mixture. Add salt to taste and garlic powder. Cook over medium heat, uncovered, until it is of gravy consistency. Cover and simmer over very low heat. Add more water if the chili gravy becomes too thick. Dip tortillas one at a time in the hot chili gravy with a wide metal spatula. The tortillas will become pliable almost immediately, which will make rolling the enchiladas easier. Soaking too long will cause the tortillas to fall apart. Place a good sprinkling of grated cheese and minced onion and about a tablespoon of the meat mixture to one side of the center of the tortilla. Roll tortilla tightly around the filling and place loose side down in a glass casserole baking dish. For best results place the enchilidas in a row with sides touching. When all enchiladas have been formed, pour the remaining hot chili gravy over all, and sprinkle generously with grated cheese, and top with chopped onion. Bake at 350 deg. F until the cheese is melted. Serve immediately. NOTES : Serve with canned refried beans, guacamole, picante sauce, tortilla chips, spanish rice, steamed tortillas and butter. For faster preparation, you can layer mixture in a casserole, starting with a little meat sauce in the bottom of the casserole, a layer of torn (in quarters) tortillas, another meat layer, sprinke of cheese and onions, and repeat layers, ending up with a layer of meat sauce topped with cheese and onion on top. Then bake until casserole is hot and cheese is melted.",

Add mushrooms, potatoes, garlic and 1/4 cup water and cook, stirring occasionally, until all vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.

Lightly spray an 8-in. square baking pan with vegetable oil. Warm each tortilla in a dry skillet over medium heat, about 1 minute per side. Place 1/3 cup of vegetable mixture in the lower part of each tortilla and roll up. Carefully place enchiladas seam side down in the baking pan, brush lightly with some of the liquid from the salsa, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. 4. To serve, divide lettuce among 6 plates. Place enchiladas on top of the lettuce. Top with salsa and garnish with cilantro sprigs. Notes: A nicely spiced entree, these light enchiladas are filled with veggies instead of the typical beef, pork or chicken. A bit of feta cheese is in the wrap for tangy flavor and creaminess. >from Kitpath with a little help from mcbuster 2.0d",

    "content": "Preheat the vegetable oil to 360 degrees F in a large pan. In a large saut\u0082 pan, heat the olive oil. Season the beef with salt and cayenne. Sear the beef for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the onions and saut\u0082 for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and tomatoes. Season with salt and cayenne. Saut\u0082 for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon a couple of tablespoons of the filling in the center of each tortilla. Spread the filling evenly in the center of each tortilla. Roll up each tortilla tightly and secure with toothpicks, making each into a flautta. Fry the flauttas in batches until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove the flauttas from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the flauttas with Emeril's Creole Seasoning. Continue frying until all the flauttas are fried. To assemble into a hero, spoon the queso on the bottom of a large platter. Arrange the flauttas over the sauce. Garnish with the guacamole and salsa. Yields: 6 servings. Air date on GMA 1/23/98",

    "content": "French Provincial Cooking [I used this to doctor a chocolate cake that dried out because it had been sitting in the fridge for several days. I crumbled the cake and mixed it with the mousse and put them in individual containers.] E. David writes: Nearly everyone knows and appreciates the old and reliable formula for a chocolate mousse-4 yolks beaten into 4 oz. of melted bitter chocolate, and the 4 whipped whites folded in. Here is a slightly different version, its faint orange flavor giving it originality. Break 4 oz of good quality bitter chocolate into squares and put in a fireproof dish in a low oven. When the chocolate is soft, after a few minutes, take it from the oven, stir in 4 well-beaten yolks, then 1 oz. of softened butter, then the juice of 1 orange. Use a Seville orange when in season; its aromatic flavor comes through better than that of the sweet orange. Beat the 4 egg whites as for a souffle and fold them into the chocolate mixture. Pour into little pots, glasses, or coffee-cups. This quantity will fill 6. Put in the refrigerator or a cool larder until ready to serve. Should you have some orange liqueur such as Grand Marnier or Curaao, add a spoonful in place of the same amount of orange juice.",
