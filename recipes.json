    "content": "* NOTE: Use 1 1/2 pounds or MORE of ripe mushrooms. The darker mushroom (older) adds a stronger flavor to the soup, that's what I usually use. I've made this with the regular white, as well as portabello mushrooms - a blend tastes fine, but the portobello tends to overpower slightly. 1. Melt butter in pot. Add sliced mushrooms, and saute gently until liquid is completely cooked out. Do not brown mushrooms. 2. Add at least 2 quarts chicken broth (reserve 1/3 cup), thyme, and bouillon. Bring to a full boil, and simmer, uncovered, until broth is reduced by 75%. Taste should be extremely strong (it will be diluted with the cream). Note: The reduction can take quite a while. 3. Mix cornstarch with reserved broth, and add to soup. Allow mixture to get very thick. 4. Gently add 2 quarts (or more) heavy cream. Blend, and bring to a gentle simmer. Taste, and adjust seasoning if needed. Thin with milk or cream if flavor is too strong, or soup is too thick. : Jocie Moravec",
