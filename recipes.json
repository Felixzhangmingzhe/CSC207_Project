    "isCooked": false,
    "content": "There's been some discussion of vitamin B12 in recent posts. A generally accepted assumption is that nutritional yeast is a source of B12. A little over a year ago, someone on the Fat-Free list mentioned that all nutritional yeasts are not fortified with B12, naming Red Star T-6635+ as one source. I asked my HFS if theirs had B12. \"Absolutely\", I was told. I asked to see the label of on the 50 pound sack they use for their bulk sales, and there was no mention of B12 on it. After calling Red Star, I received a data sheet for all their nutritional yeasts. Of Red Star's yeasts, only T-6635+ contains a significant amount of B12 (0.5 mcg per gram). When I brought this to the attention of the general manager of the HFS, he immediately ordered the T-6635+ for all future shipments. While I had no immediate concern about a B12 deficiency, I had been consuming a nutritional yeast which added no B12 to my system. I noticed that the B12 fortified yeast was a much darker golden color than the ivory color of the the unfortified yeast, but that may vary from lot to lot. A heaping tablespoon of nutritional yeast is about 8 grams. (4 mcg B12) This yeast is 4.7% fat, 35% carbohydrate and 52% protein, the rest is nitrogen and moisture. There are 2.8 calories of energy per gram. 1.80á",

I crumbled the cake and mixed it with the mousse and put them in individual containers.] E. David writes: Nearly everyone knows and appreciates the old and reliable formula for a chocolate mousse-4 yolks beaten into 4 oz. of melted bitter chocolate, and the 4 whipped whites folded in. Here is a slightly different version, its faint orange flavor giving it originality. Break 4 oz of good quality bitter chocolate into squares and put in a fireproof dish in a low oven. When the chocolate is soft, after a few minutes, take it from the oven, stir in 4 well-beaten yolks, then 1 oz. of softened butter, then the juice of 1 orange. Use a Seville orange when in season; its aromatic flavor comes through better than that of the sweet orange. Beat the 4 egg whites as for a souffle and fold them into the chocolate mixture. Pour into little pots, glasses, or coffee-cups. This quantity will fill 6. Put in the refrigerator or a cool larder until ready to serve. Should you have some orange liqueur such as Grand Marnier or Curaao, add a spoonful in place of the same amount of orange juice.",
