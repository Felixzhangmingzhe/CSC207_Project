I've made this with the regular white, as well as portabello mushrooms - a blend tastes fine, but the portobello tends to overpower slightly. 1. Melt butter in pot. Add sliced mushrooms, and saute gently until liquid is completely cooked out. Do not brown mushrooms. 2. Add at least 2 quarts chicken broth (reserve 1/3 cup), thyme, and bouillon. Bring to a full boil, and simmer, uncovered, until broth is reduced by 75%. Taste should be extremely strong (it will be diluted with the cream). Note: The reduction can take quite a while. 3. Mix cornstarch with reserved broth, and add to soup. Allow mixture to get very thick. 4. Gently add 2 quarts (or more) heavy cream. Blend, and bring to a gentle simmer. Taste, and adjust seasoning if needed. Thin with milk or cream if flavor is too strong, or soup is too thick. : Jocie Moravec",

    "content": "Melt shortening in heavy skillet. Add the ground meat and brown. Sprinkle meat with flour; mix in skillet. Add tomato sauce and 1 cup water. Mix 1/2 cup water with the chili powder to form a smooth paste; add to the meat mixture. Add salt to taste and garlic powder. Cook over medium heat, uncovered, until it is of gravy consistency. Cover and simmer over very low heat. Add more water if the chili gravy becomes too thick. Dip tortillas one at a time in the hot chili gravy with a wide metal spatula. The tortillas will become pliable almost immediately, which will make rolling the enchiladas easier. Soaking too long will cause the tortillas to fall apart. Place a good sprinkling of grated cheese and minced onion and about a tablespoon of the meat mixture to one side of the center of the tortilla. Roll tortilla tightly around the filling and place loose side down in a glass casserole baking dish. For best results place the enchilidas in a row with sides touching. When all enchiladas have been formed, pour the remaining hot chili gravy over all, and sprinkle generously with grated cheese, and top with chopped onion. Bake at 350 deg. F until the cheese is melted. Serve immediately. NOTES : Serve with canned refried beans, guacamole, picante sauce, tortilla chips, spanish rice, steamed tortillas and butter. For faster preparation, you can layer mixture in a casserole, starting with a little meat sauce in the bottom of the casserole, a layer of torn (in quarters) tortillas, another meat layer, sprinke of cheese and onions, and repeat layers, ending up with a layer of meat sauce topped with cheese and onion on top. Then bake until casserole is hot and cheese is melted.",

    "isCooked": false,
    "content": "1. Preheat oven to 350F. Prepare Salsa Mexicana (see recipe) or use a prepared salsa. 2. Lightly spray a 1 2-in. nonstick skillet with vegetable oil cooking spray. Add bell pepper and onion, and cook over medium heat, stirring until softened, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms, potatoes, garlic and 1/4 cup water and cook, stirring occasionally, until all vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in spinach, cilantro and red pepper flakes until spinach is wilted. Add feta and stir to blend. 3. Lightly spray an 8-in. square baking pan with vegetable oil. Warm each tortilla in a dry skillet over medium heat, about 1 minute per side. Place 1/3 cup of vegetable mixture in the lower part of each tortilla and roll up. Carefully place enchiladas seam side down in the baking pan, brush lightly with some of the liquid from the salsa, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. 4. To serve, divide lettuce among 6 plates. Place enchiladas on top of the lettuce. Top with salsa and garnish with cilantro sprigs. Notes: A nicely spiced entree, these light enchiladas are filled with veggies instead of the typical beef, pork or chicken. A bit of feta cheese is in the wrap for tangy flavor and creaminess. >from Kitpath with a little help from mcbuster 2.0d",

    "content": "This is method of curing fresh fish, in this case salmon, which is very easy to do at home and which is gentler (and therefore often more acceptable to children) than the more usual smoked salmon. The cured dish is not at all salty and makes a simple and fresh starter. Skin and pin-bone the salmon, taking care that all visible bones are removed. Remove and discard any dark flesh under the skin. Wash and dry the fish. Mix together the salt, sugar, pepper and half the dill. Sprinkle half the cure mixture over the fish (patting it into the flesh), put the salmon into a shallow dish (china is good), turn and sprinkle the remainder. Cover the fish tightly with food wrap and keep refrigerated overnight, turning the fish and basting it with the juices at frequent intervals. The next day remove the salmon, rinse it and then pat dry with kitchen paper. Sprinkle the remaining dill over the top side of the dish, patting it in with your hands. To serve slice very thinly with a sharp knife from top to bottom giving small thin slices edged with bright green dill. Some spring onion and creme fraiche goes well with it.
