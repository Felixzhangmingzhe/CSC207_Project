TODO list:
+* Add a way to avoid repeated Recipes with the same name(name is unique)
+* make ReadRecipeView visible
    why is it not visible?
    May because createRecipeViewModel and createRecipePresent are not injected in the constructor of ReadRecipeView
    Or because the view is not binded to the viewmodel.
    Or there is something wrong with the view it self.
